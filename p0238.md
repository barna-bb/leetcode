# Problem 238

## Approach

I had a simple solution but the performance was bad so I was trying to improve it, in the end I needed some help.

## Code

```cpp
vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {

    int size = nums.size();
    vector<int> answer(size, 1);

    int prefix = 1;

    for (int i = size - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        answer[i] = nums[i + 1] * answer[i + 1];
    }

    for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
        prefix *= nums[i - 1];
        answer[i] *= prefix;
    }
    return answer;         
}
```
